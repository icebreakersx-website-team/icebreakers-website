            <h2 class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">What started as a social app is revolutionizing the service industry</h2>
            
            <p>In 2018, Calvin Pegues had an idea: a hyperlocal social app for the modern world. He noticed that the influx of popular hookup apps had changed the landscape, and he wanted to build something that felt fresh where real people could connect in real time.</p>
            
            <p>He built it. Then the world shut down.</p>
            
            <p>When things reopened in 2021, Calvin and his team tested the app in the real world. As people gathered again in casinos, bars, and venues, something unexpected happened. The location technology that helped people to "break the ice" (see what he did there?) started solving a completely different problem.</p>
            
            <p>The team started talking to large casinos, who immediately realized the real-time location intelligence could transform how service worked. They could see that it would be good for connecting guests with the services they needed, instantly, no matter where they moved.</p>
            
            <p>The pivot was clear and the Customer Compass was born.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of just being a hyperlocal social connection app, the technology morphed into a powerful service delivery platform. Instead of "Can I buy you a drink?" it became "Find your guest anywhere." Instead of just changing how people meet, it started changing how an entire industry operates.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 3rem; color: var(--text-white) !important; font-size: 2rem;">The Problem We Saw</h3>
            
            <div style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>For decades, service delivery in casinos and live venues hasn't fundamentally changed. Servers roam floors searching for guests. Guests abandon orders because waiting isn't worth it. Revenue leaks silently.</p>
                <p>The technology exists—indoor location tracking, mobile ordering, real-time routing—but no one had combined them into a single, operations-focused system designed for how venues actually work.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 4rem 0 2rem; text-align: center;">
                <div style="width: 50px; height: 3px; background: var(--accent-violet); margin: 0 auto 2rem; opacity: 0.3;"></div>
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--accent-violet); margin-bottom: 0;">That's What Calvin Pegues Recognized</h4>
            </div>

            <div style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>After years in tech and operations, Calvin saw this inefficiency firsthand. He realized the real bottleneck wasn't ordering—it was delivery. Servers didn't need better order-taking; they needed to find guests in real time and deliver faster.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 700; color: var(--text-white);">So he built something different.</p>
